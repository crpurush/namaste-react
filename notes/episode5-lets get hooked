Never put mock data in component folder
Never use hardcoded strings in components files
Move these to some common folder like utils folder and put in similar to constants file


====================================
-> Default Export/Import:
    we can use default export when we have to export only one  thing from file
    export default Component;
    import Component from "path";
    ex:
    export default Body;
    import Body from "./components/Body";

-> NAMED Export/Import
    but for more than two constants or functions we have to do NAMED EXPORT, using export before the variable to export
    export const Component;
    import {Component} from "path"
    
    ex:
    export const CDN_URL
    export const LOGO_URL

    while importing
    import { LOGO_URL } from "../utils/constants";
