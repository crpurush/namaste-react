# npm is package manager, these packages are also known as dependencies sometimes
# package.json is configuration for npm
# Most important package in project is bundler
# Bundler bundles/packages the app with all files to production deployment ex:webpack,veet,parcel
# npm install -D parcel
2 types of dependencies
->dev dependency - required in development phase
->normal dependency  - used in production also
-D - for developement purpose

===================
in package.json
^2.13.0 - ^ upgrades the minor version
~ - upgrades the major version
===================
transitive dependencies
- our project has a dependency on parcel and parcel has some dependencies of it, those dependencies have other dependencies. we call them as transitive dependencies.
- on npm install -D parcel, it installs all dependenciesor packages code from global npm repository into node_modules folder in local
====================
.gitignore file is used to keep list of files not to be added to git

if we have package.json and package-lock.json we can regenerate all our node_modules folders, so no need to push node_modules to github
using npm install - it will do so
==========================================
npx parcel index.html
for igniting app

npm -> command used for installing package
npx parcel -> command used for executing package i.e., here executing parcel package
npx parcel index.html -> from index.html it takes as source and builds the app, deploys to localhost
